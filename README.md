# Salad-Chef
This is a video game
## Status
There are two player characters, can be controlled by WASD and arrow keys
and both have collision detection.

Created a border using a brick image which has collision detection so now
the players can't leave the screen.

Also added chopping boards, plates and a trash can. Added vegetables and
customers and added basic functionality to them.

The player can now go near any vegetable and press the __Special__ key (__SPACE__
and __ENTER__) and it gets registered. Functionality hasn't yet been added to it.

Each player has a separate inventory and can hold up to two vegetables at a time.

Customer timer bar and text element displaying the vegetables needed by each
customer have been implemented.

Player timer shows up at bottom left/right. 
## TODO
Create power ups. 

Fix up code duplication as much as possible.
