# Salad-Chef
This is a video game
## Status
There are two player characters, can be controlled by WASD and arrow keys
and both have collision detection.

Created a border using a brick image which has collision detection so now
the players can't leave the screen.

Also added chopping boards, plates and a trash can.
## TODO
Add vegetables and customers.

Bind __SPACE__ for player 1 and __ENTER__ for player 2 such that it will do context
specific action when we press it near any object such as the chopping board or
trash can.
