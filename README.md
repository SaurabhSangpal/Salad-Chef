# Salad-Chef
This is a video game
## Status
There are two player characters, can be controlled by WASD and arrow keys
and both have collision detection.

Created a border using a brick image which has collision detection so now
the players can't leave the screen.

Also added chopping boards, plates and a trash can. Added vegetables and
customers and added basic functionality to them.

The player can now go near any vegetable and press the __Special__ key (__SPACE__
and __ENTER__) and it gets registered. Functionality hasn't yet been added to it.
## TODO
Create an inventory for each player and allow it to have up to two vegetables at
any time. Will probably implement an inventory on the plates or create another
inventory in the players so that it can hold up to three chopped vegetables.
